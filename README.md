# Hello-World

Hi fellows,
Cagla is here. Do you know Inspector Gadget?
Yeah, that's my job :)
I worked for banks about 7 years as an Auditor (Inspector) for fraud.
I have completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics and I've learned coding in Python last year.
Now, it's time to combine those strengths!
My goal is becoming a Data Scientist and apply fantastic machine learning algorithms to catch frauds, to predict financial trends (stock market, FX market), in short, combining ML techniques with my financial background to get the best results.
Enjoy machine learning!
