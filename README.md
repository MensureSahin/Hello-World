# Hello-World

Hi fellows, Cagla is here.
I worked about 8 years as an auditor for banks in the fraud team. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics and, master's degree in finance and got 2 amazing professional education certificates; Applied Data Science from MIT and Data Analitics from UCSC. Now, it's time to combine those strengths! As a data science enthusiast I love to apply machine learning algorithms to detect fraud, predict financial trends (stock market, FX market), leads, and so on. Just dig (the data), it speaks for itself! Take care and enjoy machine learning!
