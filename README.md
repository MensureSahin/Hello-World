# Hello-World

Hi fellows, Cagla is here.
Do you know Inspector Gadget? Yeah, that's my job :) I worked about 5 years as an auditor for banks in the fraud team. I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics and, last year I learned to code in Python. Now, it's time to combine those strengths! My goal is to become a data scientist and apply fantastic machine learning algorithms to detect fraud, to predict financial trends (stock market, FX market), and so on. In short, combine ML techniques with my financial background to get the best results. So, take care and enjoy machine learning!
